# Anime_Recommendation_System_Analysis
This project aims to analyze anime datasets to understand the user behavior, and the find out critical columns for building a recommendation system for the anime platform.

**Group Members:** Grace Kung, Allen Chiu, Pin-Chen Kuo, Emily Su, Hannie Han, Maggie Croghan

**Executive Summary**
The project discovers anime users' demographics and rating patterns in order to find out what animes they like, and in what ways an anime platform can build a recommendation system.

In the data cleaning phase, we joined 3 data sets and kept 19 critical columns shown in Data Dictionary section. For the EDA section, we found that users are primarily aged 25-39, located in Europe and North America. The top 3 popular genres are Award Winning, Suspense, and Avant Garde. The top 3 popular sources are Manga, Original, and Web Manga. Lastly, it demonstrated no clear correlation between satisfaction and engagement levels.

The next step is discovering what factors to choose to build a recommendation system. The results reveals that there's no significant differences in preferences among groups with different demographic variables, and users exhibit high rating stability (low variance within genre/type/source). This implies that we can use a user's preference on genre, type, and source to predict what animes the user will like.

In conclusion, this project points out that an item-based recommendation approach could be more suitable than user-based approach.

**Business Value**
Enhance anime platforms' ability to increase user engagement by airing and recommendating proper contents, driving sustainable growth.
